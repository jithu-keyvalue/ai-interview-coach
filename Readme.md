ðŸ’­ How do we make the coach reject bad input?
We want to avoid broken or confusing data in the system.

ðŸŽ¯ Problem
The coach shouldnâ€™t crash when we send bad input. Letâ€™s validate and respond cleanly.

âœ… Your Task
In create_user:
- Validate role is one of: developer, designer, product-manager
- validate place is present and is a string

In get_user:
- Return 404 if user not found, instead of crashing

ðŸ§ª Test
Use Swagger UI (http://localhost:8000/docs) to try:
- invalid role
- Missing/invalid place
- get user id=0
