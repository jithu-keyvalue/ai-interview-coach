💭 How do we make the coach reject bad input?
We want to avoid broken or confusing data in the system.

🎯 Problem
The coach shouldn’t crash when we send bad input. Let’s validate and respond cleanly.

✅ Your Task
In create_user:
- Validate role is one of: developer, designer, product-manager
- validate place is present and is a string

In get_user:
- Return 404 if user not found, instead of crashing

🧪 Test
Use Swagger UI (http://localhost:8000/docs) to try:
- invalid role
- Missing/invalid place
- get user id=0
