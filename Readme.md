ðŸ’­ How to evolve DB structure without writing raw SQL like `ALTER TABLE ...`?

ðŸŽ¯ Problem  
Letâ€™s move from create_all to migrations with Alembic.

âœ… Your Task  
- Add `alembic` as a dependency in requirements.txt
- Install alembic `pip install ...` 
- Fix models.py as per our target DB table column structure
- Create migration script: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Update user table: drop role/place, add email"`
- Run the migration script: `alembic upgrade head`

ðŸ§ª Test  
- Test user creation and fetch
- Confirm new fields are reflected in DB
